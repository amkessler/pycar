# Import your csv module

# Write a function that accepts one csv filename as an argument.
# The function should open the file, read its contents and filter out rows where
# the state abbreviation is MD, writing only those rows to an md_banks.csv file.

    # Open the file to read and create the reader object

    # Open the file to write and create the writer object

    # Write our header row to the output csv

    # Loop through the rows in the original file and write only the banks
    # in Maryland to the output file.

        # If the state abbreviation is 'MD', write the row to our new file

        # Otherwise, skip this row

    # Close the original csv file

    # Close the md_banks.csv file

# Call the function, passing as an argument the name of the csv file to open.
