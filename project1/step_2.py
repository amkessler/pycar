# Import built-in python modules we'll want to access csv files and download files

# We're going to download a csv file...
# What should we name it?
file_name = ""

# Use urllib.urlretrieve() to download the csv file from a url and save it to a directory
# The csv link can be found at https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html

# Open the csv file


    # Use python's csv reader to access the contents
    # and create an object that represents the data

    # Loop through each row of the csv...
        # and print the row to the terminal
