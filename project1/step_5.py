# Import modules

# Write a function to do some exploring with strings

    # Open the csv

    # Create the object that represents the data in the csv file

    # Create a variable to represent the header row

    # From the last lesson we know the variable header_row refers to a list.
    # Let's isolate the string that is 'Acquiring Institution'

    # We'll do this by isolating in the list what is know as the index of the string

    # Let's make sure this is a string

    # Let's get the length of the string

    # Create a variable to hold our string

    # Let's see how string subscripting works...
    # Let's print the third characters

    # Let's print the first five characters

    # Let's print everything after the first five characters

    # Let's capitalize the first letter in the string

    # Let's lowercase the string

    # Let's uppercase the string

    # Close the csv file when we're done

# Call the function, passing as an argument the name of the csv file to open.
