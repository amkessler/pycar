# Import modules

# Write a function to do some more exploring with strings

    # Open the csv

    # Create the object that represents the data in the csv file

    # Create a variable to represent the header row

    # From the last lesson we know the variable header_row refers to a list.
    # Let's isolate the string that is 'Acquiring Institution'

    # Create a variable to hold our string

    # Let's evaluate the uppercase version is equal to the lowercase version

    # Let's remove the space that is present in the string

    # Let's change the space to an underscore

    # Let's look at the strip method by giving it a value

    # Let's look at what the strip method does to the ouput of above

    # Let's try to split the string on the space

    # Let's get the datatype for the thing we just created.
    # First let's create a variable to hold this string

    # Then let's get the type

    # Because it's a list, we can again get a specfic item by it's index and we're back to where we started

    # For the final item, let's use the length of the list and lowercase the two strings we created to create a sentence

    # Close the csv file when we're done

# Call the function, passing as an argument the name of the csv file to open.
