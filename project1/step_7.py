# Import modules

# Write a function to do some exploring with integers

    # Open the csv

    # Create the object that represents the data in the csv file

    # Create a variable to represent the header row

    # Let's get the first row of data

    # Let's create a varaible off the bat to isolate the integer that is the zip code

    # Let's output the value

    # Let's get the length of the integer

    # For kicks, let's multiply zipcode by 2.
    # We should get 67876, assuming the zipcode we're using is 33938.
    # Because it's not an integer, when we try to double it, python will simply repeat the string.

    # Let's double-check its type

    # Let's convert the string to an integer

    # Now let's try some math...

    # Multiplication

    # Division

    # Addition

    # Subtraction

    # Order of operations

    # Close the csv file when we're done

# Call the function, passing as an argument the name of the csv file to open.
