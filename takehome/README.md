## Version control

If you want to learn **git** just visit the [tryGit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) site.

##Keep Practicing
Try our "[PyCAR basics](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/tommeagher/PyCAR_basics)" iPython notebook to continue exploring data types and simple methods, or look at the commented [code in Python](PyCAR_basics.py).
Tony DeBarros also taught a fantastic class at NICAR on [getting started with Python](https://github.com/anthonydb/python-get-started).

Here's a great [cheatsheet](http://sleet.aos.wisc.edu/~gpetty/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Python_qr.pdf) for basic python types and functions. And you should probably bookmark this fun and handy graphic of [common Python errors](http://i.imgur.com/WRuJV6r.png).
It's worth your time to take a look at Tony DeBarros' [Python snippets](https://github.com/anthonydb/python-snippets), scripts for common tasks he's found useful.

##Good libraries to explore
* __[csv](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/systems-programming/using-the-csv-module-in-python/)__, for working with the [best tabular data format](http://pymotw.com/2/csv/).
* The __[re](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions)__ library for matching text with [regular expressions](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html).
* __[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)__, a library for more easily making requests to web urls. One good [tutorial](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) and [another](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/requests/using-requests-in-python).
* __[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)__, for parsing html or xml, with [a gentle introduction](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/beautifulsoup/beautifulsoup-4-python) and [another tutorial](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/beautifulsoup/web-scraping-with-beautifulsoup).
* __mechanize__. [A tutorial](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/mechanize/browsing-in-python-with-mechanize/) with its own [cheat sheet](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-mechanize-cheat-sheet)
* __json__. [Work with json](http://pymotw.com/2/json/) like it's a dictionary.
* __[Xlrd](http://www.python-excel.org/)__. Do your Excel in Python.
* __[pandas](http://www.bearrelroll.com/2013/05/python-pandas-tutorial/)__, for data analysis. pandas' dataframe object is like a table.
* And a cool collection of quick overviews on standard library modules.
